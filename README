The Image Resizer and 'api/images?filename=filename.ext&width=number&height=number' work for jpg file 
and create a resize image with a filename filenamewidthXheight.jpg

e.g. 'api/images?filename=mountain.jpg&width=300&height=300' creates a resize image with 
filename mountain300X300.jpg

input image file should be located inside full folder in ImageProcessingAPI directory
resize output image will be created inside thumbs folder in ImageProcessingAPI root directory

api/images endpoint will work only with a minimum of width and height of 50
below 50 will not work but will the ImageResizer function any width & height will work
